# Cobra case

This is a simple case design for the [Cobra computer](http://cobrasov.com).
It consists of a bottom panel (base.dxf) and a top panel (cover.dxf, alternate
with logo cover_logo.dxf).  The Cobra mainboard and keyboard attach to the
bottom panel by standoffs.  The top panel covers the mainboard and has holes
for mounting two 3.5" floppy drives vertically on top.  A monitor can be
placed on top of the top panel.

I had the panels laser-cut from 0.35" acrylic.
